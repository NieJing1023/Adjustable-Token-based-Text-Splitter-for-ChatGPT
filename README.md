**Adjustable Token-based Text Splitter for ChatGPT**

Description:
This project provides an adjustable token-based text splitter designed specifically for use with ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a token limit of 4096 for its input, which necessitates splitting longer texts into smaller parts before sending them to ChatGPT.

While there are existing solutions available online, they lack the ability to adjust the number of tokens for the split text. As a result, the generated text chunks may still exceed ChatGPT's token limit due to differences in token counting algorithms. This issue is particularly prominent for non-English languages, as the support for them is often sub-optimal, leading to oversized text chunks.

Our text splitter stands out by allowing users to specify the desired token limit for the split text. If the generated text chunks still exceed ChatGPT's requirements, they can be easily re-split to fit within the constraints. This tool is designed to support all languages in theory.

Please note that this code was written by ChatGPT-4 with my assistance in providing guidance.
